                <p>The goal of this project is to track the relationships among PhDs in
                Biological Anthropology. Back in 2013, we were inspired by
                <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.20532">a paper by Elizabeth Kelley and Robert Sussman</a> in the <em>American Journal of Physical Anthropology</em>,
                which presented "genealogy data" on field primatologists.
                Genealogy is probably the more accurate term, but we like to think of it as a
                phylogenetic tree. Using web tools, we are expanding on previous work by providing
                interactive visualizations of this data, and by allowing people from all over the world
                    to contribute their data.</p>
